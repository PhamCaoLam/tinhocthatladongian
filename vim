Hello, i'm Vim editor of this terminal shell. I'm very useful and convenient to use. Please use me when you need to edit or create a text file. Using me you can either read a file or write on it, without having to manually open it in the conventional way. Just type vim <file_name> and tata, an editor window will come up. However, to be able to efficiently utilize me, you should get familiarized with some conventional key commands: 
- type i: for inserting a character
- type Esc: for quitting the change mode and returning to the normal mode.
(In normal mode, you can't write, only read) 
- type a: for appending to the text 
- type :wq for saving and quitting the editor window.
